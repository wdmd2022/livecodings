# JavaScript is Cool
or,
# A Walk Through Websiteville

![JavaScript looks upon his helpers](https://github.com/wdmd2022/livecodings/blob/2ed8cd9f263b49bb214b69ee360f83a7bb9a6ee9/JavaScript%20is%20Cool/javascript_presentation_people.jpg)

This presentation was an absolute blast!

To introduce the concept of JavaScript, and its role within websites of providing interactivity, I created a participation-focused presentation where I alternated back and forth between coding as myself, and acting as my alter ego, JavaScript (himself).

The plot of the presentation was simple: one day, I (JavaScript) am tending to my garden of buttons -- nice buttons that don't do anything (because we all know that `<button>` elements by themselves do nothing!) and to my shock I discover that someone has vandalized a button to say 'show apple.'
(check out the video!)

Naturally, I recruit a group of helpers from the audience to play roles such as Event Listeners, and piece by piece, we build up the proper functioning of a button in a webpage.

On the code side, we go from simple alerts to calling APIs that provide us with pictures of apples.
