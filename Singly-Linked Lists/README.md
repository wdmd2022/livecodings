# Making Friends with Singly-Linked Lists

This was one of my first presentations at Atlas School, and it was such a joy!


I made lots of physical 'pointer' cut-outs and, with the help of a mannequin 'head', 'NULL on a stick', and lots of audience volunteers, explained the concept of singly-linked lists in C.


We practiced adding and removing nodes (by changing where we were pointing) and coded out sample code to help us make a 'best friends list.' With the help of even more volunteers going through several skits, I also walked through demonstrations, both acted-out and live-coded in C, on how to re-rank and modify our list of best friends.

It was a great day everybody walked out of there with more friends than before!
