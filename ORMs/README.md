# ORMs:
'SQL: the Sequel'
or,
'Falling in Love with CRUD' (delivered 2/14/24)

This was a really fun talk given to 2nd-Trimester students to introduce the concepts of ORMs, just after they had learned about SQL databases and MySQL.

Since they were immersed in Python, I chose to talk about SQLAlchemy, and made an appearance in character as 'Orm, the SQLAlchemist'

... and occasionally even appearances as myself!
