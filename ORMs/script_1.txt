volunteer 1 == Person 1: has a list of valentines
volunteer 2 == DATABASE: the DATABASE


(Person 1 walks over to DATABASE and tries to hand the a piece of paper)


Person 1: Please remember this list (attempting to hand it to DATABASE)

DATABASE: No, I can't

Person 1: Please

DATABASE: I really can't

Person 1: This is very annoying

DATABASE: I'm not trying to be annoying

Person 1: How hard can this be?

DATABASE: Please don't talk to me that way.

Person 1: I'm not trying to be rude. Please just store this information in a table of valentines.

DATABASE: I'm not saying that you are being rude. But please don't talk to me that way.

Person 1: What's wrong?

DATABASE: You're not being specific enough.

Person 1: It's a simple list, please just stop hassling me.

DATABASE: I can only do the exact database operations you ask me to do. I need you to be specific.

Person 1: You seriously need me to go line by line? I have a lot of valentines to send.

DATABASE: If you want me to store them, you need to be specific.

Person 1: Ugh, fine! I will tell you what to do specifically in my-database.

DATABASE: Okay, I'm listening.

Person 1:
    INSERT INTO valentines (name, message) VALUES
        ('Robin', 'Dear Robin, Happy Valentine''s Day'),
        ('Alex', 'Dear Alex, Happy middle of February!'),
