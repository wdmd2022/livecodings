# Design Language presentation

This presentation was a brief one -- 45 minutes -- and summed up broad yet actionable topics in website and UI design for the benefit of Full-Stack Web Development students at Atlas School (formerly Holberton School Tulsa).

Bad design is so easy to spot -- and so is good, generally -- but articulating why something is bad or good is another matter! 

We talked about how to think about web site design, especially the conventions in presenting Saas products, and covered concepts such as:
- the fold
- calls to action
- spacing
- whitespace
- typography

And much more. It was a fast-paced, fun presentation with a lot of question and answer from the audience. 

One of the few presentations I did not create a costume for!
